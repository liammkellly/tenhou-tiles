# tenhou-tiles

> This replaces the tiles on the internet mahjong client Tenhou by custom design tiles.
> The primary use is to play with western friendly tiles (ie. arab numerals and latin script).
> It rewrites some code in the Tenhou client to use external resources instead of the standard ones.
> If you don't want or don't know how to install this, you can try it here: http://tentiles.rf.gd
